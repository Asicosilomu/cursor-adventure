# cursor-adventure
A nice little game where you navigate your mouse cursor through various levels, while avoiding obstacles and unlocking doors. Resurrected this game from like 2 years ago and removed all of the redundant spaghetti code.

The game has 7 levels and you can either play it on GitHub Pages or download it locally. Disponibil și în **Limba Română**.
